Suppose a uniform cylindrical pole or wire fixed in a vertical direction at its lowest point, and carried to such a height that the vertical position becomes unstable and flexure begins; it is required to determine this height.

Let $2a$ be the diameter in inches, and A the sectional area of the pole in square inches: and $E$ be Young's modulus of elasticity of the substance, expressed in gravitation measure of lb to the square inch.

Then, if $\rho$ be the radius of curvature of the central fiber of the pole, the bending moment of resilience (the unit being the inch-lb)
$$
= EI \frac{1}{\rho}=EAk^3\frac{1}{\rho}
$$
Take the origin $O$ at the top of the pole in its vertical position and the axis $Ox$ directed vertically downwards:

Then if $APB$ be the central line of the pole, supposed to be slightly curved under its own weight, we may put $ \frac{1}{\rho}=\frac{dp}{dx}$, where $\rho=\frac{dy}{dx}$, and therefor the bending moment at $P$
$$
=EAk^2\frac{dp}{dx}
$$
This must be equated to the moment of the weight of $PB$ about $P$, which
$$
=wA\int\limits_0^x(y'-y)dx'
$$
