<img src="/assets/images/portrait_square.jpg" width=100px align="left">My name is Phil Koelpin. I am an aerospace engineer with a demonstrated history working in the aviation and space industries. I specialize in structural analysis.

This blog is where I'm able to deep dive into topics that interest me. These topics are often related to stress analysis, but occasionally I get sucked into something that's not directly applicable to my day job.

Programming is an interest of mine that is weakly tied to structural analysis. It's usefulness as an efficiency booster makes an indispensable tool to automate stress analysis. The initial creation of this blog stems from my curiosity on how static site generators (Jekyll) work.

Over the years I have accumulated a collection of stress analysis reference texts. These days most books and manuals can be found in pdf form online with a quick google search, but I prefer to have a hard copy in front of me. A portion of this blog is dedicated to cataloging my reference collection. 

The name "Aluminum Overcast" comes from the B-17 of the same name. The name always struck me as a creative description of the overwhelming nature of WWII bombers. The majority of structures I work on are aluminum, so the nickname also fits as the title for a blog focused on structural analysis.
