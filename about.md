<img src="/assets/images/portrait_square.jpg" width=100px align="left">My name is Phil Koelpin. I am an aerospace engineer with a demonstrated history working in the aviation and space industries. I specialize in structural analysis.

This blog is where I'm able to deep dive into topics that interest me. These topics are often related to stress analysis, but occasionally I get sucked into something that's not directly applicable to my day job.

Over the years I have accumulated a collection of stress analysis reference texts. These days most books and manuals can be found in pdf form online with a quick google search, but I prefer to have a hard copy in front of me. A portion of this blog is dedicated to cataloging my reference collection. 

The name "Aluminum Overcast" comes from the B-17 of the same name. The name always struck me as a creative description of the overwhelming nature of WWII bombers. The majority of structure I work on is aluminum, so the nickname also fits as the title for a blog focused on structural analysis.
